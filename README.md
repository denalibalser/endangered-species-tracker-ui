## Summary 
I knew I wanted the theme of this project to be something I was passionate about. As an animal-lover and convservation buff, I chose to build an endangered species tracker. The premise being that a user can signup or login to access the web app’s functionality; fetching data from the Environmental Conservation Online System’s (ECOS) API of global endangered species and the ability for a user to save a species to their dashboard in order to track it's status. This is the frontend React/Redux UI to the project, including TailwindCSS for styling, component structure, dispatch actions that fetch to ECOS API and Rails backend, Thunk middleware, reducers, React Routing, and component state.
